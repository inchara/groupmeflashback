# groupmeflashback

Groupme is an awesome messaging app, that lets you upvote your friends' posts , pictures, and all the fun conversations that happen. What happened eventually after 1 year of using groupme was, I wanted to look back at all the silly but funny messages, and pictures, but I had no way to do that without wasting a whole day on the groupMe web app, and looking at all those not-so-good pictures that were so many! And that's when I wondered - why not filter through images using an app?

This app (that I call groupmePensieve) present here - https://inchuition.com/pensieve basically helps you select any of your groupme groups, and choose the popularity level on which you want to filter messages

Once you're done with that, you can create a video from the past images, almost as if you can have a whole memory from a groupme conversation saved with you! You could show it off at a party, or just have it for the sake of nostalgia. After all, this is the pensieve.

This uses open source tools such as whammy to create videos and html foundation css for the style.
